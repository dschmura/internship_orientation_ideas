# Write a Letter of recomendation or Article Assignment
**[Home](../../README.md)** 

As we near the half way point for your internship, I want to make sure you each have an artifact that you can point people to that tells the story your internship experience. To that end, I want you each pick one of the options below so we can get cracking!

## THE RULES:

>***DO NOT USE GENERATIVE AI FOR YOUR FIRST 3 DRAFTS OF THIS ASSIGNMENT.*** This one is about you, so I really want it to be ***you*** generated. You can use AI for help with grammar, spelling, and style, but let's get a solid draft first.

> ***First Draft Due: 6/15/2023 (8pm)***

## THE CHOICES:

Please select one of the following options:

### 1.) Letter of Recommendation.

Write your letter of recommendation, from me, reflecting on your time so far. What have you accomplished so far? How was your introduction? What skill(s) or competencies have you demonstrated? Pretend you are me, writing to a potential employer, and tell them why they should hire you. 

** This is a really difficult exercise for some people. When I first did this, I spent a lot of time in my head and worrying about over/under representing myself. It is especially difficult as I am asking for you to 'imagine' what I would write. 

Here's the thing. You have ready access to the source. Write your draft, and ask me for feedback. (*I would like this to actually eventually evolve into your actual letter(s), which I will use your versions as my primary source material.*)

### 2.) Newsletter Article
Write an article about your internship experience for the LSATS newsletter and/or the UMSI newsletter. Similar to option #1, I would like you to reflect on your experiences and accomplishments during the internship program. Here's a link to an article I wrote about the internship program last year that may or may not be interesting. https://github.com/lsa-mis/WADS_InTurn/blob/main/resources/Intern-Article-pre-edits_trimmed.pdf


## THE PRODUCT(S):

At the end of this exercise I would like to have a written artifact that tells the story of your internship experience. Either a letter of recommendation, or an article for the newsletter, ready to go. Something that you can link to from your resume or send to potential employers.
