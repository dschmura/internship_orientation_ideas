Project Brief


The https://its.umich.edu/internship/home page has a section to help internship applicants select what 'preferred position' they are interested in pursuing. From that page;

"Our internship acts as a matching program, where we pair talented interns with the projects needed in the university. While the following list highlights the job positions we typically seek, we may not offer all of these positions every year.

To help us select the best position for each intern, please choose your preferred position in our application that best matches your career goals after graduation. We will then cross reference your preference and experiences to curate your internship experience."

Describing the different roles in the information technology space can be a challenge. There are often overlapping areas of interest, different understandings of the work associated with each role, not to mention the rapidly evolving field itself. 

In order to try to capture what a group of REAL interns understand about the roles before they lose their 'beginners mindset', we would like you to interview your peers. During this time, meet as many of your fellow interns as you can. Find out where they are working and the kind of work they are doing this summer. Hint: You're going to need to know this information for a project this afternoon!
