# Meet the Team Exercise: 

 Our new team members will conduct brief interviews of the staff (10 - 15 minutes). The idea is to give our new team members an opportunity to meet everyone on the team (and to give them experience meeting people they don't know with some structured questions). The interviews will be very short (3 - 5 questions).

 In addition, the interviewers will ask the interviewee if they would be willing to pose for a [screenshot selfie](#screenshot-selfie) with a 'mascot'.

# Bite-sized piece of advice

In a few sentences, what advice can you give us to be successful this summer and/or in our careers?

# Quirks and a Quandary Game

Quirks are a nice way to share something personal (not too personal) about yourself with someone else. It is kind of like letting someone in on a little secret, but without the pressure. The Quirks and a Quandary game gives it a little twist. The idea is, you have to tell the intern(s) 3 quirks, two of which are true, and one that is a lie. (** The reveal will happen at our next stand up...see below.)

Quirks generally fall into a couple of categories
  
  - Hobbies and interests
  - Famous people you may have met 
  - Food 
    - Can your food touch on your plate?  
    - Do you have a consistent way to approach the options on your plate?  Like veggies first.  Or must you take one bite from each food type on your plate in a clockwise pattern around your plate?  
- Past histories
  - Did you have a previous career(s)? 
  - 

In our WA@Ds standup on Wednesday, May 18th, we will have the interns introduce each team member based on the information gathered in the interview. They will also read the three 'quirks'. At this point the interns will poll the rest of the team to see if we can guess which 'quirk' was a lie.

# Screenshot Selfie 

As part of the interview, please ask the participant to hold up a 'mascot'. A mascot, in this circumstance is some object, around which they can tell a story. This can be anything, an old trophy, a piece of wedding cake you purchased from King Edward VIII's wedding to Wallis Simpson, your diploma, a good luck sock... The mascot can be a ludicrous or impractical object and the story can be completely made up.  This is an excuse to be goofy. For inspiration maybe watch a few episodes from [8 out 10 Cats Does Countdown]()
